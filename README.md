# Connect x

This is a 2 player terminal game.

Same as Connect 4, but Board Dimensions can be changed along with the number of discs that need to be in a row together for a player to win.

I call this number of discs as 'x', hence the name Connect x

Player 1 uses the disc 'X' (not to be confused with the lower case x) and Player 2 uses the disc 'O'

To run the program, run the file main.py
